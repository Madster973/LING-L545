# Project

This project explores innovative approaches in computational linguistics to categorize accents using text-based methods. It employs and compares various clustering algorithms and advanced language models like M-BERT and Word2Vec to analyze and categorize accents in nuanced ways. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of these methods across various datasets and accent categorizations, highlighting the potential of contextualized representations in understanding linguistic diversity and accent variations. The research contributes significantly to the field by offering new insights into accent analysis using computational techniques.
